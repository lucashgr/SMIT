# SMIT
SMIT, Simulador do Motor de Indução Trifásico, or 3-phase Induction Motor Simulator, is an open source program developed in Python that allows you to simulate an induction motor using catalog data or data obtained through tests.

This application was developed by master's student Lucas Henrique Gonçalves Ribeiro and his advisor, Professor Dr. Lane Maria Rabelo, from the Graduate Program in Electrical Engineering (PPGEL) at the Federal University of São João del-Rei. The goal of the work was to develop a Python program that allows users to simulate three-phase induction motors, with or without faults, using computational models.

The Python algorithm and the SMIT user manual, in both Portuguese and English, are available on GitHub. Due to its size, the executable was uploaded to SourceForge: https://sourceforge.net/projects/smit/

Unfortunately, I am not very experienced in building applications, so I was unable to resolve the security issues with the executable, causing it to trigger antivirus software. However, the algorithm poses no intentional security risk to the machine.
